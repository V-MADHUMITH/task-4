DESCRIPTION:  
This project focuses on spam email detection using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. The goal is to classify emails as either spam or ham (not spam) based on their content.  

Key Features:
- Dataset Used: spam.csv (contains email messages labeled as spam or ham).  
- Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, and TF-IDF vectorization.  
- Machine Learning Model: A classification model trained using scikit-learn.  
- Model Persistence: The trained model and vectorizer are saved as .pkl files for reuse.  
- Deployment: A Python-based script (app.py) to predict email classifications.  

How It Works:  
1. Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and converted into numerical format.  
2. Feature Engineering: TF-IDF is used to extract meaningful text features.  
3. Model Training: A classification model (e.g., Na√Øve Bayes, SVM) is trained.  
4. Prediction: The trained model predicts whether an email is spam or ham.  
5. Deployment: The model is saved and can be used for real-time classification.  

 How to Run the Project: 
1. Install dependencies:  
   pip install pandas scikit-learn nltk flask
2. Train the model using:  
   python train_model.py
3. Run the application for predictions:  
   python app.py
   

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how Machine Learning & NLP can be used to detect spam emails efficiently. The trained model can be further improved with more data and better algorithms.
